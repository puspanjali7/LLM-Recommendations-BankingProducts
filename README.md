# 🚀 Project Name
AI-Powered Personalization Engine



## 🎯 Introduction
The problem lies in the growing expectation for deeply personalized experiences—modern customers want products, services, and content tailored exactly to their unique preferences, behavior, and emotions. 
Traditional rule-based systems struggle to keep up with this demand, especially across multiple channels and data types like text, voice, and images. Businesses also face challenges in interpreting vast, unstructured data and acting on it in real time. 
This gap has led to the need for Generative AI-powered systems that can intelligently analyze complex customer data and generate dynamic, personalized recommendations and insights at scale.



## 🎥 Solution Approach
The solution is a Stream lit-based AI engine that delivers hyper-personalized financial insights using multimodal inputs.
It processes structured data (Excel), voice (via Whisper), and images (via EasyOCR & BLIP) to build enriched customer profiles. Sentiment analysis guides tone, while Groq’s LLaMA-3.3-70B generates personalized recommendations, offers, and behavioural insights. 
A financial health engine scores users based on transactions and sentiment. Sentence embeddings enable product matching via cosine similarity. A feedback loop (simulated RLHF) refines recommendations based on user ratings
